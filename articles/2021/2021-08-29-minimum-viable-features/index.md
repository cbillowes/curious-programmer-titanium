I've been working on my [blog](/blog/what-i-did-to-build-a-high-performing-and-seo-happy-gatsby-blog/)
and I noticed that I had rolled out the site in one big bang deployment and then later worked on smaller
features that I rolled out as they were developed.

It is easy to get wrapped up in completing a feature after feature
and keep enhancing without going to production. Where is the line drawn when it comes to trying to
to release a complete MVP or just a normal feature?

## Big bang deployment

Know what the minimum requirements for the feature are and work on them first.
Expand as you release things trying to avoid the big bang :boom: deployment approach
as it is going to cause a few problems with:

- outdated dependencies
- increased complexity
- delayed time to market
- higher possibility of bugs :bug:
- too many moving parts
- being harder to test

## Checklist

Create a checklist of things to consider when building a minimum viable feature.
Mine is as follows:

- Does it **perform** well? I try to make it fast and efficient by offering a good and secure user experience.
- Does it **function** as it should? I build it to work and work well. Human alert :exclamation:
  I attempt to flaunt my agility and quickly fix issues that I spot in production.
- Have I build everything I need **structurally**? There are pages and components that I will need
  to create. I create what I need and nothing more.
- Is it **consistent**? Consistency applies to the code as well as the user interface. Have I followed
  the appropriate guidelines or at least followed what is currently implemented.
- Am I offering a **good user experience**? This is both for the developer and the user.
- Is my feature adequately exposed so that it can be **discovered**? This is ideal for crawlers for SEO
  and social media sharing. If users are supposed to see the new feature then make sure it is
  prominent.
- Is my **spelling and grammar** correct? This relates to my code, articles and any content I have on my website.

## Closing thoughts

With my latest experience I have come to realize and appreciate the importance of iterative releases
by building an MVP and then releasing feature after feature thereafter.

It helps to go through a list of items to ensure the feature matches the quality
I expect it to. I am human so I get it wrong sometimes but the important thing is to try.
